# Playdate Template Example Game
This is a small example game to dip your toes into Playdate game development after completing the [Playdate template](https://github.com/SquidGodDev/playdate-template/tree/main) environment setup. The game is a simple one where you control a capybara with the crank to dodge rocks. The `main.lua` file contains the final project. The implementation of the game code is broken up into steps in the files labeled `step1` through `step9`. You can verify the accuracy of your code at each step by copying and pasting your code and the step code in [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/).
