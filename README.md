# Playdate Template Example Game
This is a small example game to dip your toes into Playdate game development after completing the Playdate template environment setup. The game is a simple [Helicopter Game](https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/helicopter-game) clone where you control a capybara with the crank to dodge rocks. The `main.lua` file contains the final project. The implementation of the game code is broken up into steps in the files labeled `step1` through `step9`. You can verify your code at each step by pasting your copy of the code and the step code in [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/).
